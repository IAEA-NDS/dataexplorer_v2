The IAEA Nuclear Reaction Data Explorer is an open-source project to visualize the scientific and public nuclear reaction data. We provide pre-processed evaluated nuclear data libraries and a continually-updated EXFOR dataset alongside powerful analytic and visualization tools to the community. Our aim is to help developments nuclear engineering by enhancing the understanding of nuclear physics, and improvements of the quality of nuclear data.
